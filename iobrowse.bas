'Private Const BIF_DONTGOBELOWDOMAIN& = &H2&  ' do not include network folders below the domain level in the dialog box's tree view control.
'Private Const BIF_STATUSTEXT& = &H4&         ' include a status area in the dialog box. The callback function can set the status text by sending messages to the dialog box. This flag is not supported when BIF_NEWDIALOGSTYLE is specified.
'Private Const BIF_RETURNFSANCESTORS& = &H8&  ' only return file system ancestors. An ancestor is a subfolder that is beneath the root folder in the namespace hierarchy. If the user selects an ancestor of the root folder that is not part of the file system, the OK button is grayed.
'Private Const BIF_EDITBOX& = &H10&           ' version 4.71. Include an edit control in the browse dialog box that allows the user to type the name of an item.
'Private Const BIF_VALIDATE& = &H20&          ' version 4.71. If the user types an invalid name into the edit box, the browse dialog box calls the application's BrowseCallbackProc with the BFFM_VALIDATEFAILED message. This flag is ignored if BIF_EDITBOX is not specified.
Private Const BIF_NEWDIALOGSTYLE& = &H40&    ' version 5.0. Use the new user interface. Setting this flag provides the user with a larger dialog box that can be resized. The dialog box has several new capabilities, including: drag-and-drop capability within the dialog box, reordering, shortcut menus, new folders, delete, and other shortcut menu commands. Note  If Component Object Model (COM) is initialized through CoInitializeEx with the COINIT_MULTITHREADED flag set, SHBrowseForFolder fails if BIF_NEWDIALOGSTYLE is passed.
'Private Const BIF_BROWSEINCLUDEURLS& = &H80& ' version 5.0. The browse dialog box can display URLs. The BIF_USENEWUI and BIF_BROWSEINCLUDEFILES flags must also be set. If any of these three flags are not set, the browser dialog box rejects URLs. Even when these flags are set, the browse dialog box displays URLs only if the folder that contains the selected item supports URLs. When the folder's IShellFolder::GetAttributesOf method is called to request the selected item's attributes, the folder must set the SFGAO_FOLDER attribute flag. Otherwise, the browse dialog box will not display the URL.
'Private Const BIF_UAHINT& = &H100&           ' version 6.0. When combined with BIF_NEWDIALOGSTYLE, adds a usage hint to the dialog box, in place of the edit box. BIF_EDITBOX overrides this flag.
Private Const BIF_NONEWFOLDERBUTTON& = &H200&   ' version 6.0. Do not include the New Folder button in the browse dialog box.
'Private Const BIF_NOTRANSLATETARGETS& = &H400&  ' version 6.0. When the selected item is a shortcut, return the PIDL of the shortcut itself rather than its target.
'Private Const BIF_BROWSEFORCOMPUTER& = &H1000&  ' only return computers. If the user selects anything other than a computer, the OK button is grayed.
'Private Const BIF_BROWSEFORPRINTER& = &H2000&   ' only allow the selection of printers. If the user selects anything other than a printer, the OK button is grayed. In Microsoft Windows XP and later systems, the best practice is to use a Windows XP-style dialog, setting the root of the dialog to the Printers and Faxes folder (CSIDL_PRINTERS).
'Private Const BIF_BROWSEINCLUDEFILES& = &H4000& ' version 4.71. The browse dialog box displays files as well as folders.
'Private Const BIF_SHAREABLE& = &H8000&          ' version 5.0. The browse dialog box can display shareable resources on remote systems. This is intended for applications that want to expose remote shares on a local system. The BIF_NEWDIALOGSTYLE flag must also be set.

'Private Const BIF_USENEWUI& = (BIF_EDITBOX Or BIF_NEWDIALOGSTYLE) ' version 5.0. Use the new user interface, including an edit box. This flag is equivalent to BIF_EDITBOX | BIF_NEWDIALOGSTYLE. Note  If COM is initialized through CoInitializeEx with the COINIT_MULTITHREADED flag set, SHBrowseForFolder fails if BIF_USENEWUI is passed.
